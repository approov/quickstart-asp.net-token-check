# Approov Integrations Examples

[Approov](https://approov.io) is an API security solution used to verify that requests received by your backend services originate from trusted versions of your mobile apps, and here you can find the Hello servers examples that are the base for the Approov [quickstarts](/docs) for ASP.Net.

For more information about how Approov works and why you should use it you can read the [README](/README.md) at the root of this repo.

If you are looking for the Approov quickstarts to integrate Approov in your ASP.Net API server then you can find them [here](/docs).


## Hello Server Examples

To learn more about each Hello server example you need to read the README for each one at:

* [Unprotected Server](/servers/hello/src/unprotected-server)
* [Approov Protected Server - Token Check](/servers/hello/src/approov-protected-server/token-check)
* [Approov Protected Server - Token Binding Check](/servers/hello/src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check)


## Docker Stack

The docker stack provided via the `docker-compose.yml` file in this folder is used for development proposes and if you are familiar with docker then feel free to also use it to follow along the examples on the README of each server.

If you decide to use the docker stack then you need to bear in mind that the Postman collections, used to test the servers examples, will connect to port `8002` therefore you cannot start all docker compose services at once, for example with `docker-compose up`, instead you need to run one at a time as exemplified below.

### Build the Docker Stack

The three services in the `docker-compose.yml` use the same Dockerfile, therefore to build the Docker image we just need to used one of them:

```bash
sudo docker-compose build approov-token-binding-check
```

Now, you are ready to start using the Docker stack for ASP.Net.

### Command Examples

To run each of the Hello servers with docker compose you just need to follow the respective example below.

#### For the unprotected server

Run the container attached to your machine bash shell:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up unprotected-server
```

or get a bash shell inside the container:

```bash
sudo docker-compose run --rm --service-ports unprotected-server zsh
```

#### For the Approov Token Check

Run the container attached to the shell:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up approov-token-check
```

or get a bash shell inside the container:

```bash
sudo docker-compose run --rm --service-ports approov-token-check zsh
```

#### For the Approov Token Binding Check

Run the container attached to the shell:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up approov-token-binding-check
```

or get a bash shell inside the container:

```bash
sudo docker-compose run --rm --service-ports approov-token-binding-check zsh
```
